Binaries exploitations
I like reverse engineering binaries, so I started doing little challenges. Yeah, that's all.

What's that?
I start to do some CTF, especially ones were the aim is to reverse engineering binaries to find vulnerabilities to exploit. That helps me to develop my skills in Pentesting, Assembly and low-level machine logic.

This repo is just a wrapper for some challenges I solved.
